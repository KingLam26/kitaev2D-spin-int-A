# Integer-spin-S Kitaev 2D Honeycomb Model

We consider the arbitary integer-spin-S Kitaev 2D Honeycomb Model [arXiv:1811.05668] in the anisotropic limit using perturbation theory. 

Explicitly compute the coefficients for each diagram for integer-spin-S kitaev2D case.



As of 26/09/24, we have used the code for spin-2, spin-3, spin-4.
Matches Koga's results exactly.
